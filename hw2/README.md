# hw2.2
# 1 step: Fine tuning the Detectron2 model with own dataset. This step is finished in the jupyter notebook. 
#     a. open NB_for_training.ipynb 
#     b. make sure there exists Detectron2 environment
#     c. register dataset by initializing class Detectron2Wrapper
#     d. run part 2.1.3 Train model with custom data
#     e. the fine tuned model with filename "model_final.pth" is generalized under the output folder.
    
# 2 step: Making prediction using trained model. This step is processed in the python script.
#     There is the explanation for all functions in the uploaded script, just modify the path of the mask_test and img_test, if we expect some different
#     result.
